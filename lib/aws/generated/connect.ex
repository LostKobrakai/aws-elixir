  @moduledoc """
  Amazon Connect is a cloud-based contact center solution that you use to set up
  and manage a customer contact center and provide reliable customer engagement at
  any scale.

  Amazon Connect provides metrics and real-time reporting that enable you to
  optimize contact routing. You can also resolve customer issues more efficiently
  by getting customers in touch with the appropriate agents.

  There are limits to the number of Amazon Connect resources that you can create.
  There are also limits to the number of requests that you can make per second.
  For more information, see [Amazon Connect Service Quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/amazon-connect-service-limits.html)
  in the *Amazon Connect Administrator Guide*.

  You can connect programmatically to an Amazon Web Services service by using an
  endpoint. For a list of Amazon Connect endpoints, see [Amazon Connect Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/connect_region.html).

  Updates the identity information for the specified user.

  We strongly recommend limiting who has the ability to invoke
  `UpdateUserIdentityInfo`. Someone with that ability can change the login
  credentials of other users by changing their email address. This poses a
  security risk to your organization. They can change the email address of a user
  to the attacker's email address, and then reset the password through email. For
  more information, see [Best Practices for Security Profiles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/security-profile-best-practices.html)
  in the *Amazon Connect Administrator Guide*.
